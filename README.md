## Description

This is a short quiz on basic Javascript functionality. 
Its goal is to test to see if you've learned any javascript
I learned how to save data to local storage so high scores remain after refresh

## Installation

No instalation required. Runs in browser and high scores are saved to local storage.

## Usage
The view highscores in the top left corner takes you to a page displaying the top 5 high scores and the initals associated with them.
On the main page click the start button to begin
5 questions will appear. A new one every time you answer a question. Each question has 4 choices but only 1 is correct. 
Guessing wrong deducts 15 seconds from the timer.
The game ends when either all 5 questions are answered or the time runs out.
When the game ends a input field and submit button appear. Input your initals to save your score.
